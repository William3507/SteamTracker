Description: Unfortunately, Steam's API is a bit annoying when it comes to giving out Achievement names. 
The Api provides the names of the achievements, but only in internal format only (ACHIEVEMENT_WIN_SCENARIO_01_IMMORtAL).
While not the end of the world, for readability, I'm going to try and make it the display name of the achievement (Gengis Khan).

'''

#Input should be 2 json objects, one with the global achievement stats, and one with the readable name.
